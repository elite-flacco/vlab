## 🎯 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account

### 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd vlab
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in your Supabase credentials:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here

# Optional - for GitHub integration
VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_oauth_app_client_id_here
```

### 🛠️ GitHub Integration Setup

To enable GitHub integration for task-to-issue creation:

1. Create a GitHub OAuth App at https://github.com/settings/developers
2. Set the authorization callback URL to `{your-domain}/auth/github/callback`
3. Copy the Client ID to `VITE_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` environment variable
4. Configure `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` in your Supabase Edge Functions environment
5. Required OAuth scopes: `repo`, `user:email`

6. Run database migrations:

```bash
# Apply the migrations in your Supabase dashboard or using the CLI
```

7. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### 📊 Core Tables

- `profiles` - User profile information with anonymous user support
  - `is_anonymous` - Flag indicating guest/anonymous accounts
  - `anonymous_claimed_at` - Timestamp when anonymous account was converted
  - `email` - Unique partial index (allows multiple NULL emails for anonymous users)
- `projects` - Project containers
- `prds` - Product Requirements Documents with versioning
- `prd_versions` - Complete version history for PRDs
- `tasks` - Task management with dependencies and priorities
- `roadmap_items` - Project roadmap and milestone tracking
- `scratchpad_notes` - Flexible note-taking system
- `prompts` - AI prompt library and templates
- `secrets` - Encrypted storage for sensitive data (values never retrieved in SELECT queries)
- `deployment_items` - Deployment checklists and configuration tracking
- `design_items` - Design documentation and asset management
- `github_tokens` - Encrypted GitHub OAuth tokens for user authentication
- `github_repositories` - User's connected GitHub repositories for issue creation
- `posts`, `comments`, `votes` - Community features for social interaction

### 📝 Version Control System

The PRD versioning system provides:

- **Automatic Version Tracking** - Every PRD update creates a new version
- **Complete History** - Full content and metadata for each version
- **Version Comparison** - Side-by-side comparison of any two versions
- **Change Descriptions** - Optional descriptions for each version update

### 👤 Anonymous User Support

VLab supports full functionality for anonymous users without requiring registration:

- **Multiple Anonymous Sessions** - Database schema supports unlimited concurrent anonymous users via partial unique index on email field
- **Full Feature Access** - Anonymous users can create projects, use all modules, and interact with community features
- **Seamless Account Claiming** - Convert anonymous accounts to registered accounts while preserving all data
- **Data Transfer System** - Comprehensive database functions (`transfer_anonymous_data()`, `claim_anonymous_account()`) ensure zero data loss during conversion
- **Schema Support** - `is_anonymous` flag and `anonymous_claimed_at` timestamp track account lifecycle

#### Database Schema Design

- Email field allows NULL for anonymous users (enforced via check constraint for non-anonymous users)
- Partial unique index on email permits multiple NULL values while enforcing uniqueness for registered users
- RLS policies properly handle both authenticated and anonymous user access patterns
- `handle_new_user()` function includes auth schema in search_path for reliable profile creation

#### ⚙️ Database Functions

- `create_prd_version()` - Automatically creates version snapshots
- `get_prd_version_comparison()` - Returns comparison data for two versions
- `handle_new_user()` - Automatically creates profiles for new users, supports anonymous users with proper schema handling
- `transfer_anonymous_data()` - Database function for transferring anonymous user data during account claiming
- `claim_anonymous_account()` - Database function for converting anonymous accounts to registered accounts
